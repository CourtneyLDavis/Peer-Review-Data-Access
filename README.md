## Abstract
We propose pathways to broaden access to peer review data to make more expedite progress in reducing peer review bias, which currently perpetuates barriers for historically excluded groups. Our pathways could help diversify the voices heardrepresented in the literature beyond those from privileged backgrounds and those affiliated with journals.
